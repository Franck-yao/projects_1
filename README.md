Diabetic Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health and lifestyle factors of individuals, and it utilizes a supervised learning algorithm to make predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns. However, you can obtain a similar dataset from various public health repositories or healthcare providers. The dataset should include a combination of numerical and categorical features related to the individual's health, such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, glucose levels, and family history of diabetes, among others. Additionally, the dataset should have a target variable indicating whether the individual has been diagnosed with diabetes or not.

Model Training
To train the diabetic prediction model, the dataset needs to be preprocessed and split into training and testing subsets. The preprocessing step involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. The training set is then used to train the machine learning algorithm, and the performance of the model is evaluated using the testing set.

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook named diabetic_prediction.ipynb that walks you through the entire process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebook provides detailed explanations and code examples for each step, making it easy for you to understand and reproduce the results.
